= Dataset

Dataset provides a simple API for creating and finding sets of data in your database. Check out Dataset::RecordMethods and Dataset::ModelFinders.

Dataset loads data intelligently if you use 'nested contexts' in your tests (RSpec, anything that uses Test::Unit::TestCase subclassing for creating nested contexts):

    describe Something do
      dataset :a              => Dataset :a is loaded (at the right time)

      it 'should whatever'
      end

      describe More do
        dataset :b            => Dataset :b is loaded. :a data is still there

        it 'should'
        end
      end

      describe Another do     => Database is restored to :a, without re-running :a logic
        it 'should'
        end
      end
    end

The goal is to see a marked improvement in overall test run speed, basing this on the assumption that it is faster to have the OS copy a file or mySQL dump and load. Of course, we may find this to be a false assumption, but there were plenty of bugs in the former 'Scenarios' - addressing that afforded the opportunity to test the assumption.


Dataset does not prevent you from using other libraries like Machinist or factory_girl. If you were to used either of those, you could have a dataset like this:

    require 'faker'

    class OrganizationsDataset < Dataset::Base
      Sham.name  { Faker::Name.name }

      Organization.blueprint do
        name { Sham.name }
      end

      def load
        name_model Organization.make, :org_one
      end
    end

The benefit is that you can reuse interesting sets of data, without sacrificing the utility of those other libraries.

    describe Organization, 'stuff' do
      dataset :organizations
    end

    describe Organization, 'other stuff' do
      dataset :organizations
    end

== Installation

Install the plugin:

    ./script/plugin install git://github.com/aiwilliams/dataset.git

In your test_helper.rb/spec_helper.rb:

    require 'dataset'
    class Test::Unit::TestCase
      include Dataset
      datasets_directory "#{RAILS_ROOT}/spec/datasets"
    end

If you don't use rspec_on_rails, or you have specs that aren't of the RailsExampleGroup type, you should do this in spec_helper.rb:

    require 'dataset'
    class Spec::Example::ExampleGroup
      include Dataset
      datasets_directory "#{RAILS_ROOT}/spec/datasets"
    end

If you were a user of the Scenarios plugin, and want to do as little as possible to get going (assumes you are using rspec_on_rails):

    require 'dataset'
    Scenario = Scenarios = Dataset
    class Test::Unit::TestCase
      include Dataset
      class << self
        alias_method :scenario, :dataset
      end
    end
    class ScenariosResolver < Dataset::DirectoryResolver
      def suffix
        @suffix ||= 'Scenario'
      end
    end
    Dataset::Resolver.default = ScenariosResolver.new("#{RAILS_ROOT}/spec/scenarios")
